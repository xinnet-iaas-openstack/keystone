Welcome to Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service!
====================================================

Keystone is a cloud identity service written in Python, which provides
authentication, authorization, and an OpenStack service catalog. It
implements `OpenStack's Identity API`_.

This document describes Keystone for contributors of the project, and assumes
that you are already familiar with Keystone from an `end-user perspective`_.

.. _`OpenStack's Identity API`: http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-identity-service/2.0/content/
.. _`end-user perspective`: http://docs.openstack.org/

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Keystone and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_.  Also see the :doc:`community` page for
other ways to interact with the community.
